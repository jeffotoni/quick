# ðŸ†” MsgUUID Middleware - Quick Framework ![Quick Logo](/quick.png)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The MsgUUID Middleware in Quick automatically generates a unique identifier (UUID) for each request and adds it to the response headers.
This helps track requests, improve debugging, and correlate logs.

---

### ðŸš€ How It Works
The MsgUUID Middleware works by:

- Intercepting all incoming HTTP requests.
- Generating a unique UUID for each request.
- Attaching the generated UUID to the response headers for tracking.
- Helping log correlation and debugging across distributed systems.

### âœ… Key Features  

| Feature                    | Benefit                                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| ðŸ†” **Unique Identifier**   | Adds a UUID to each request for tracking and correlation.  |
| ðŸ”„ **Automatic Generation** | No need for manual UUID creation, added seamlessly.       |
| ðŸ“Š **Enhanced Debugging**   | Makes log analysis easier by attaching request identifiers. |
| ðŸš€ **Lightweight & Fast**   | Does not impact performance, operates efficiently.         |

This example generates a unique request identifier with the MsgUUUID middleware.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/jeffotoni/quick"
	"github.com/jeffotoni/quick/middleware/msguuid"
)

func main() {
	q := quick.New()

	// Apply MsgUUID Middleware globally
	q.Use(msguuid.New())

	// Define an endpoint that responds with a UUID
	q.Get("/v1/msguuid/default", func(c *quick.Ctx) error {
		c.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")

		// Log headers to validate UUID presence
		fmt.Println("Headers:", c.Response.Header())

		// Return a 200 OK status
		return c.Status(200).JSON(nil)
	})

	log.Fatal(q.Listen("0.0.0.0:8080"))
}
```
### ðŸ“Œ cURL 

```bash
$ curl -i -XGET http://localhost:8080/v1/msguuid/default
```
### ðŸ“Œ Response 
```bash
"Headers":"map"[
   "Content-Type":["application/json"],
   "Msguuid":[5f49cf4d-b62e-4d81-b46e-5125b52058a6]
]
```
