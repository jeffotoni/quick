### Welcome to the Quick example repository! 🚀

 **Quick** was born to be a simple route manager, but with time we saw that it could expand into something bigger.
We started abstracting everything that was repetitive and became too verbose and we were leaving everything minimalistic as possible.

Quick is now a lightweight and performative framework for route management in Go, built on the native net/http library. It offers flexibility, extensibility and an intuitive design to facilitate the development of high-performance APIs.
